# Assignment compliance — final verification

Final check of the `api-validator` submission against every section of the
assignment. Branch: `main`. Last verified live: **full suite 14 passed**
(countries 4 + weather 10, with `RESTCOUNTRIES_API_KEY` set).

**Bottom line:** all Tasks, Requirements, Evaluation Criteria, the CI Pipeline
Requirement (incl. bonus), and the Claude Code Usage requirements are **met**.
No required changes outstanding. Two *optional* enhancements are noted at the end.

---

## 1. Tasks (1–7)

| # | Task | Status | How |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `config/environments.yaml`, two environments | ✅ Met | `countries` + `weather`, each with `base_url` + `max_response_time` + `min_results_count` as the single source of truth. **Deviation:** `countries` uses REST Countries **v5** (`…/countries/v5`, Bearer) instead of the deprecated v3.1 — see *Deviations*. |
| 2 | Env fixture injects base URL + thresholds by `--env` | ✅ Met | `conftest.py` `env` fixture resolves the `Environment` from the test marker and injects base URL/thresholds/auth; `api_client` is built from it. Tests never read config directly. |
| 3 | Countries tests (region, name, all, cross-ref) | ✅ Met | `tests/countries/test_countries.py`: Europe count > 40 (paginated), Germany schema via `CountryValidator`, `/all` population invariants, and the name→region cross-reference. **Deviations:** v5 field names; `/all` requires population > 0 only for inhabited (with-capital) countries — see *Deviations*. |
| 4 | Weather tests (5 cities, temp range, hourly, tz) | ✅ Met | `tests/weather/test_weather.py`: 5 cities from `test_data/cities.json`, temperature −80..60 °C, hourly count > 0, timezone presence — all via `ForecastValidator`; no inlined data. |
| 5 | Respond within YAML `max_response_time`, not hardcoded | ✅ Met | `assert_within_threshold` reads `env.max_response_time`; called after **every** request (incl. per page during pagination). |
| 6 | `--env countries\|weather\|none`, via `pytest_addoption` | ✅ Met | `pytest_addoption` registers `--env`; default `all`; deselection in `pytest_collection_modifyitems`. Choices are **config-derived**, not hardcoded. |
| 7 | Combined Allure report, section per environment | ✅ Met | The `env` fixture centrally applies `allure.dynamic.parent_suite(env.name)` + `label("environment", …)`; combined report has a section per environment. CI uploads + publishes it. |

## 2. Requirements (4)

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `pytest`, `requests`, `allure-pytest`, `pyyaml` | ✅ Met | All four in `requirements.txt` (version-pinned). |
| 2 | `--env` custom CLI flag | ✅ Met | `pytest_addoption` in top-level `conftest.py`; choices config-derived + `all`. |
| 3 | Environment fixture in **top-level** `conftest.py` | ✅ Met | `env` fixture (+ session-scoped `environments`) in the repo-root `conftest.py`. |
| 4 | `test_data/cities.json` committed | ✅ Met | Tracked in git, 5 cities, loaded via `load_cities()` and parametrized. |

## 3. Evaluation Criteria (5)

| Criterion | Weight | Status | How it's addressed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Environment abstraction design | 30% | ✅ Strong | `ENV_NAMES` derived from config; frozen `Environment`; marker-resolved `env` fixture injects URL/thresholds/auth; `--env` machinery and markers config-derived; `BaseValidator` hierarchy. Adding an API = config + validator + suite, core untouched. |
| YAML-driven config (zero hardcoded) | 25% | ✅ Strong | No hardcoded URLs/thresholds; `base_url`/`max_response_time`/`min_results_count` flow YAML → `Environment` → tests/gate. `min_results_count` is now actually *enforced* (Session 14 fix). Only intrinsic-data constants remain (e.g. `MIN_EUROPE_COUNTRIES`, temp bounds), which the rules explicitly allow. |
| Test logic reuse across two APIs | 25% | ✅ Met | Both suites share one `APIClient`, one `BaseValidator` hierarchy, one `assert_within_threshold` gate, the `env`/`api_client` fixtures, the `--env` selection, and the Allure grouping. Per-API code is thin (validator + suite). |
| CLI flag implementation | 10% | ✅ Met | `pytest_addoption`; default `all`; deselection logic; choices derived from config. |
| Allure report per-environment sections | 10% | ✅ Met (exceeds) | Centralized `parent_suite`/`label`; plus GitHub Pages publish, per-branch previews, and `main` trend history. |

## 4. CI Pipeline Requirement

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — all met, **including the bonus**.

| Requirement | Status | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Triggers on push to **any branch** | ✅ Met | `on: push: branches: ['**', '!gh-pages']` + `pull_request`. |
| Sets up Python + installs deps | ✅ Met | `actions/setup-python` (3.12) → `pip install -r requirements.txt`. |
| Runs the **full** test suite | ✅ Met | `pytest -v` (no `--env`) → all environments; emits Allure + JUnit. |
| Uploads test report as artifact | ✅ Met (exceeds) | Uploads `allure-results`, `allure-report` (HTML), and `junit.xml`. |
| Fails on test failure **or quality-gate breach** | ✅ Met **(verified in CI)** | `Run tests` step has no `continue-on-error`; gates are plain assertions → a breach fails the build. **Proven:** a forced `min_results_count` breach turned CI red on the gate assertion while the report still published (`if: always()`). |
| **(Bonus)** test summary in job output | ✅ Met | `scripts/ci_summary.py` writes a summary to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. |

## 5. Claude Code Usage (Required)

| Required item | Status | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude/rules/` — ≥3 framework-specific files | ✅ Met | `code-style.md`, `framework-rules.md`, `testing-standards.md`. |
| `.claude/skills/` — ≥2 files | ✅ Met | `test-generator.md`, `validator-generator.md`. |
| Log: ≥2 tasks with parallel agents (what / why-independent / time saved) | ✅ Met | `CLAUDE_LOG.md` Session 4: Agent A (countries) + Agent B (weather), independent (frozen base, disjoint files), ~270s (~46%) saved. |
| Log: one architectural decision validated with Claude | ✅ Met | Session 4: `--env` via markers vs. shelling out; chose markers, followed it. |
| Log: one case Claude was **wrong** (what + why) | ✅ Met (exceeds) | Session 4: two cases (v3.1/`rc_live_demo`; fresh-client cold-start); more in Sessions 5 & 6. |
| Log: how rules changed Claude's output (before/after) | ✅ Met | Session 4: inline `assert "capital" in …` → `CountryValidator().validate(...)`. |
| Task: skeleton first, then architect yourself | ✅ Met | Session 4 "Workflow". |
| Task: parallel agents, 2 workstreams | ✅ Met | Session 4 (as above). |
| Task: edge cases — valid vs hallucinated | ✅ Met | Session 4: split explicitly. |
| Task: extensibility review → acted on | ✅ Met | Session 4 (auth modeling); reinforced by later extensibility work. |

## Deviations (intentional, documented)

Both trace to one decision — **migrating `countries` from the deprecated REST
Countries v3.1 to v5**:

1. **v3.1 → v5.** The free, no-auth v3.1 API was retired and returns a
   `{"success": false}` stub; building against it would never pass. v5 is the
   live equivalent (Bearer token, free tier), resolved from `RESTCOUNTRIES_API_KEY`;
   when the key is absent the suite **skips** (CI stays green). The validator and
   tests are recalibrated to the v5 shape (wrapped envelope, `offset` pagination,
   renamed fields). Documented in the README.
2. **Population rule.** The literal "every country has population > 0" is false in
   real v5 data (uninhabited territories report 0). The test enforces the correct
   invariant: non-negative for all, strictly positive only for countries with a
   capital.
